# Voximplant Quality Issues Demo (Android)

This demo demonstrates how to handle quality issues alerts of Voximplant Android SDK. 
The application supports audio/video and conference calls between this Android app and other apps that use any Voximplant SDK.
Based on MVP architectural pattern.

## Key features
The application is able to:
- listen to quality issues
- log in to the Voximplant Cloud
- make an audio/video and conference call


#### Android 9
Because of the [limited access to sensors in background](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/pie/android-9.0-changes-all#bg-sensor-access) in Android 9,
we have made a foreground service to access microphone while app is in the background.

See the following file for code details:
- [CallService](src/main/java/com/voximplant/demos/quality_issues_demo/ui/call/CallService.java)

#### Android 10
Because of the [restrictions on starting activities from the background](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/background-starts) in Android 10,
we have made NotificationHelper class build and show full screen notifications

See the following file for code details:
- [NotificationHelper](src/main/java/com/voximplant/demos/quality_issues_demo/utils/NotificationHelper.java)
